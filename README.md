How to Install: `npm install`
Running locally: `npm start`
Run Tests: `npm test`
Example Calls: Refer to the Tests :). There is also a Postman file included in this repository. This includes a test hook which will automatically set your authentication token, however you may need to configure you environment.

The config folder is included for demo purposes.

### Overview
This is a photo exchange platform where users can upvote their favourite photos by spending virtual credits. Each user starts with 0 credits, and receives a credit for each image that they upload.

### Features
**Server Functions**
\* = no token required 
|  |  |
|--|--|
| User | - Create User* <br>- Login User* <br> - Logout user <br>- Delete self <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Cascade delete all user images |
|Image| - Upload images/ Batch Upload <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Filter files to only allow jpg and png files smaller than 16MB <br> - Get My Images <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Toggle public / private only <br>- Toggle Image Privacy <br> - Delete image <br> - Delete all images
|Upvote|- Upvote an image <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Increments uploader credits, decrements upvoter credits (only if upvoter has sufficient credits)<br> 	- Remove Upvote from an Image <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Returns credits to sources. User credits will not dip below 0|

**Security / Auth**
- Tokenization
	- Tokens are used to track user session and to authenticate the user behind every call. Aside from creating and logging in, every request requires a token. CRUD operations validate that the resource is being modified only by users who have the permissions (the creator).
- Password Hashing
	- Passwords are encrypted using bcrypt and a shared secret


## Approach
The most important constraint in this scenario was time. As a result, I chose to prioritize development speed by working with technologies that would allow me to get up and running quickly. I also wanted to avoid over-designing this application, so I designed it for the use case that I had in mind. If the use case changes, the design can always be revisited. 

## Technology Choices
| Purpose | Name | Reason|
|--|--|--|
|Language  | Javascript | I had some light experience building servers with Javascript, so I wanted to stick with a language that would allow me to get up and running as soon as possible |
|Runtime  | Node.js | Node's event loop improves speed and scalability by allowing for non-blocking I/O operations. <br> NPM has an extremely rich package ecosystem - Why reinvent the wheel?
|Database| MongoDB Atlas| I chose to use a non-relational database, as it would allow me to connect to a database without spending time writing SQL. This allowed for very straightforward database read and write operations.

### NPM Packages
| Purpose | Name | Reason|
|--|--|--|
|Server  | Express | Well documented package that allowed me to quickly configure a web server |
|Database Wrapper  | Mongoose | MongoDB wrapper that provide hooks|
|Image Uploads  | Multer | Processing and applying rules for image file uploads |
|Image Conversion  | Sharp | Converting images to Buffers for storage |
|Password Hashing  | bcrypt | Hashing passwords so that they're not stored as plaintext |
|Tokenization  | jsonwebtoken | Used for authentication and login/logout|
|Testing  | Jest | Testing library |
|Testing  | Supertest | Makes requests to the server when testing |
|Development| Nodemon | Hot reloading when developing |

### Technology Tradeoffs
- I used mongoDB's cloud offering, Atlas, in order to avoid consuming resources while developing locally. At a larger scale, this would affect latency.
- Storing the image as buffers imposes some restrictions on the file size depending on the CPU architecture that is running the application. I made this decision in order to quickly and efficiently store images. At a larger scale, I would use bucket storage or a CDN in order to store and serve images rather than storing them directly in the database.
- Javascript's dynamic typing can make it less robust than a compiled, statically typed language.

## Testing Strategies
- Most endpoints are individually tested with a "good" and "bad" flow
- Tests are run sequentially, since they are sharing the same database
- Within each test suite, tests are run sequentially. This means that the tests may affect each other. 
- Some integration tests between modules


## Areas of Extension
|  |  |
|--|--|
|Code Improvements|- Add a layer of abstraction by creating a service layer between the API and Models. This would make testing easier, and would allow for more descriptive function names<br> - Test more edge cases <br> - More descriptive error codes |
|Architecture| - Store images outside of database to support larger files and improve speed |
|Features| - Allow users to sort photos by trending / popularity <br> - Allow users to add and search photo tags |
|Misc.| Improve documentation to make it easier to demo :)
